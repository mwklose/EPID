## Agenda:
    - Ultimate purpose:
        - SER workshop?
        - 

## Results so far:
    - Trial 1: failure (misunderstood)
    - Trial 2: overlapping step functions
        - Alright, but relies on a couple of assumptions
            - Even, normal distribution around true value and CIs
            - Is this always the case? NO???
            
    - Trial 3: will have to be bit mapping
        - Although very computationally intensive, necessary
        - Also allows for stronger control of shading
