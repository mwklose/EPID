# Meetings.MD

## Agenda:
    - Ultimate purpose:
        - SER workshop? Deadline September 10th? NOT FOR ME. 
        - What are next steps needed?
    - Adding more?
    - Going forwards: 

If time:
    - BIOS662
        - Not getting much out of it, recorded lectures
        - Worth coming to meetings for an hour? 
    - BIOS minor common --> What about CS minor? Would it be worth it?

## Results so far:
    - Trial 1: failure (misunderstood)
    - Trial 2: overlapping step functions
        - Alright, but relies on a couple of assumptions
            - Even, normal distribution around true value and CIs
            - Is this always the case? NO???
    - Trial 3: shading rectangles
        - Allows finer control
        - Not straightforward/reproducible way to do this (imshow seems most promising)
            
    - Trial 4: will have to be bit mapping
        - Although very computationally intensive, only way to more or less guarantee
        - Also allows for stronger control of shading


Next step: Seaborn heatmaps as way to go forward.
